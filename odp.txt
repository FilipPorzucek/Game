Hi Madison,
It's great to hear from you! Your friends' plan to get a working holiday visa and explore our country's traditional culture sounds fantastic. There are several opportunities they could consider.
Seasonal Festivals and Events: During the summer, our country hosts many events in both villages and cities. These are often thematic events related to the history of our country. They can help organize these events or sell items at stands. In Kraków, we have festivals related to the Wawel dragon and events commemorating the Battle of Grunwald.
Tourist Guides at Cultural Sites: Working as tourist guides at cultural sites is also a great option. They can guide tours in English for international tourists. The biggest challenge is that they will need to learn about the history of the places where they will work, but I think it's possible. They can look for positions at places like the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Wawel Castle in Kraków, or the Wieliczka Salt Mine.
One of the best areas is Kraków and its surroundings, which are rich in history. The Tricity area, located on the Polish seaside, will also be a great choice, as there is plenty of seasonal work available.
Of course, there are many other interesting opportunities, but I believe the ones I have proposed are the best. I hope your friends will enjoy their stay in Poland and learn about our history.

Best,
Filip
