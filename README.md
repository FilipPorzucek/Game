this is the millionaire game. In the game, we answer questions and move on to the next stages. 
The lifelines that we can use at any time will help us with this. The game was written in TypeScript as a college project.
Questions are drawn from the board and will never be repeated in one game. 
Lifebuoys can only be used once per question
