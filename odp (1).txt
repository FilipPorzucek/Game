Hi Madison,

It's great to hear from you! Your friends' plan to get a working holiday visa and explore our country's traditional culture sounds fantastic. There are several opportunities they could consider.
Sesonal Festivals and Events. During the summer in our caountry we have a lot of events on the village or in the city. These are often thematic events related to the history of our country. They can help with organise these events or sell something at stands. In Cracow we have festival which refers to the Wawel dragon, or or events referring to the Battle of Grunwald.
 I think yourist guides at cultural sites is good work too. They can be a guides in english language for tourists from abroad. The biggest disadvantage is that they have to learn about history of place where they will works. But i think its possible.They can look for positions at places like the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Wawel Castle in Krak√≥w, or the Wieliczka Salt Mine.
One of the best areas is Krakow and its surroundings, which are very historic places. Tricity, a city on our Polish seaside, will also be a great area, as there is certainly a lot of seasonal work.

Of course, there are many other interesting works, but I think the ones I have proposed are the best. I hope your friends will have fun during their stay in Poland and learn about our history.
Best,
Filip.
